<p>The economic crisis and the competition has made many companies and businesses to think out of the box and to think more realistically about everything that they do. One important thing is to understand the 'Software Cost' which has become a killer for most of the companies investing without a clear reason sometimes, just following the trend.<br />
Microsoft has become the major player for operating system and eating into more and more markets. But the cost of the software has moved skyward and it seems more logical to go for <a class="zem_slink" title="Linux" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Linux</a> today rather than tomorrow when it's too late.<br />
Enough with the management talks and let's go to the topic :)</p>
<p>For a long time I have been a Linux lover, I fell in love with Fedora a long time ago then only I moved to Ubuntu. Still what I feel is that Fedora is for the developer when placed with Ubuntu. Ubuntu is for the more novice users who does not develop. Even the company I work for is moving to Linux and I am happy that I could help in certain areas.Here I will not talk about how to install the stuff but I will mainly talk about the tools that can be used from a developers angle.</p>
<p>Note Pad:<br />
'gedit'is always there and can be customized to be the basic developer tool with the additional plugins and some customizations.</p>
<p>IDE:<br />
eclipse is the development tool which you can use for most of your developments. Java/J2EE tools, <a class="zem_slink" title="PHP" href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank" rel="homepage">PHP tools</a>, C++ development tools of CDT and Sub-eclipse(Subversion Plugin) covers most of the development areas required by a standard developer. Additional support for distinct languages like Erlang is also with eclipse. Or else you can always use Emacs for langues like Erlang. OK OK.... I'm talking more on Erlang because I use it and it is one of my favorites along with PHP.</p>
<p>Version Control:<br />
Next is Version Controlling, I have seen many of my colegues using many tools but after digging and 'googling' I have found that the best tool for someone like me who has been using a tool like <a class="zem_slink" title="TortoiseSVN" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">TortoiseSVN</a> is <a class="zem_slink" title="RabbitVCS" href="http://rabbitvcs.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">RabbitVCS</a> which looks to be the best SVN client for me.</p>
<p>Compare and Merge:<br />
Meld is one of the most popular tools for this type of activities along with <a class="zem_slink" title="Kompare" href="http://www.caffeinated.me.uk/kompare/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">KDiff</a>.</p>
<p>SSH:<br />
Next thing you want is the <a class="zem_slink" title="Comparison of SSH clients" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">SSH client</a>,<br />
hmmm.... putty which is the free Windows SSH client is there for Linux also but you can always use the <a class="zem_slink" title="Unix shell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Linux shell</a> with sshmenu configured with keyring to remember passwords.</p>
<p>SFTP/FTP:<br />
You can directly connect for file transfers or you can use connect to server option or else go for <a class="zem_slink" title="FileZilla" href="http://filezilla-project.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">FileZilla</a>.</p>
<p>Instant Messaging:<br />
IM is another Issue many have as there is no support for Voice Calls for most of the protocols in Linux.<br />
Pidgin is my favorite <a class="zem_slink" title="Instant messaging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IM client</a> for a long time now. But the inability to make voice/video calls has made it the second option in Ubuntu 9.10 to Empathy which supports <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Talk" href="http://www.google.com/talk/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">GoogleTalk</a> Voice.<br />
Guys there's bug with Empathy in the current release. It does not use the system proxy and does not have a feature to configure a proxy, which means that it should use the system proxy. It is a major bug as I see, proxy's are a used almost everywhere and this may just help pidgin to move back with the newly added GoogleTalk voice and video feature.<br />
Version 2.6 and above Pidgin has voice and video calling feature with GoogleTalk. If you dig a more you will find Windows Live and Yahoo compatibles which I do not use and have not done much digging. If you use only IM you will always have pidgin. which I'm quite sure that will add support to other protocols also.<br />
Skype is there for Linux but with no conferencing, I have found some articles talking about some additions which add these to Linux but has never used them.</p>
<p>SVN, SSH and many other features can be operated through the command line if you are a fan of the Linux Shell.</p>
<p>So if any one reading this blog has concerns on any tool that you may require I may be able to help you with time to come as I may also face the same issue. You are always welcome to add comments and make this blog more complete which I can use to update this with more relevant and useful data.</p>
