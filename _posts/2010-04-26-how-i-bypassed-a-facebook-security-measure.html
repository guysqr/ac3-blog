<p>Social networking is the next marketing and communication tool everyone is looking at. Facebook is one major player in that consideration.</p>
<p>I have been digging more into sites like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook </a>and I will publish a post very soon explaining the risks of Facebook. For the moment I would like to mention about a security flow that I discovered with Facebook.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First thing I did was creating a Facebook account for a friend of mine at office. The account was created from my personal internet connection trough a Sri Lankan IP.</p>
<p>Then I had to re login to this account from my office where Facebook is blocked. I went through a site which bypasses the proxy to gain access to Facebook. The IP was a different one and Facebook was intelligent enough to identify that the logged in location is suspicious using the IP.</p>
<p>So there was a "road-block" a security check point setup by Facebook to verify whether the real account owner is logging in, it requests for the birth day. Oops I forgot the birth day I have put to that account because I just put some date to create the account thinking that I will be able to change that later.</p>
<p>There was no way to enter the account, then what I did was requesting for a password reset and was able to gain access to the account as soon as the password was reset. Then after few requests to Facebook and there was this road-block again, but by that time I was able to get the birth day and pass that successfully. A potential hacker may also use this method to gain access to accounts which is one security flow Facebook has to fix as I see, but in my case which helped me to recover the Facebook account.</p>
