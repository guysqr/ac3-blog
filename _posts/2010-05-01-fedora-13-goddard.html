<p>Fedora is the freedom in Operating Systems as far as I see, which is one of the top players in Linux distributions.</p>
<p>The latest version of Fedora, Fedora 13 code named "GODDARD" is about to be released and the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/13/Schedule">project plan</a> can be found at their site which has changed the initial release date from the 11th of May 2010 to the 18th of May 2010.</p>
<p>If you are eager you can get the latest beta of fedora from the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease">pre-releases </a>section in their site.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As a developer I really fell in love with this version after seeing this video and I will definitely be moving to 13 as soon as it's released.</p>
