<p>This time I'm going to share another experience with the Mobitel connection I have started to use recently.<br />
There is this service which is called self care by Mobitel. I created an account, which does not show my current bill (it says that this is a data package. so what?) and I can see the data usage but up to which date?</p>
<p>So much for self care.</p>
<p>Oh! all-of-a-sudden it crashes showing all the information about the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a> server they have used and submitting the user information in plain text. Good luck for security!</p>
<p>There was this link which says subscribe to xxx service. Normally clicking on a link would show information about the service you are subscribing and will ask for another confirmation before you are subscribed. As soon as clicking on the link it says "you have subscribed to the xxx service".<br />
When I go to that link now it says "you are already subscribed" and no way which I found to remove the subscription. I dont have a mobitel connection to make free calls to their customer care which can hardly be reached anyway.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
So I decided to send a mail, which I am waiting for a response. I will share the reply (if I get one) with you in my next blog most probably. Let's see how I'am treated and whether the customer is really the king (anyway this is their problem, no need for the king :P)</p>
<p>The most amazing thing is except for the ill-designed link no other place has the information about the company which developed this system. Well... you will be amazed that, it's a famous local web development company who is boasting about the government services which they are providing all over their website. God Bless! the ordinary man who pays the taxes and uses theses systems.</p>
<p>Find below my message to Mobitel:<br />
<span style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;">Dear m3team,</span></span></p>
<div style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;">I have logged on to the self-care web at </span><a href="https://selfcare.mobitel.lk/MyAccount/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0b5394;">https://selfcare.mobitel.lk/MyAccount/</span></a><span style="color:#0b5394;">.</span></div>
<div style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;">I have accidentally clicked on the subscribe for </span><strong><span style="color:#0b5394;">xxx</span></strong><span style="color:#0b5394;"> link which has subscribed me for the service without taking any confirmation from me.</span></div>
<div style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><span style="color:#0b5394;">Please remove that subscription as i do not use this service and please take off any charges associated with that as that is your system's problem of not having a confirmation.</span></div>
