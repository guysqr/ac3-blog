<p><strong>GoogleTalk status always showing as 'Available' even after sign out</strong> seems to be a problem with many users, where they were shown online to buddies even after they have sign out from all possible GoogleTalk logins. All the cases have been reported after logging in to GoogleTalk from third party mobile clients. (worst is <a href="http://www.ebuddy.com/">eBuddy</a>)</p>
<p>Reasons may be that the mobile data connections get interrupted and are with connectivity spikes very often due to the mobility factor. Some bug in the client causes the connection not to be closed properly. I'm not a XMPP/Jabber guru but if you dig a bit more you might find the reason.</p>

My case was with the official IM client by Nokia. The client stopped working all-of-a-sudden and I was having conversations on this over twitter with <a href="http://twitter.com/nokiamessaging">@nokiamessaging</a> which then they fixed and just after fixing that this issue came up, which is quite normal I can very well understand that as a developer. I never though that this happens with Nokia also :D. So I had to start the conversation again with <a href="http://twitter.com/nokiamessaging">@nokiamessaging</a> which they then transfered to <a href="http://twitter.com/NokiaHelps">@NokiaHelps</a> on twitter which accepted that it was their bug(this may also be because of a bug with GoogleTalk). Suggested solution for me was to contact Nokia support which was unfortunately was not available for Sri Lanka. I was suggested some resources online while they look for support options for me which actually I have not received a reply so far.<br />

Anyways I was quite sure that this would go away after sometime as it is very unlikely that GoogleTalk servers will keep a non responsive session forever. Which eventually did happen after few days. I wanted a quick solution which I did not get :(<br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>Anyways I tried the following also which may have helped.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>- At the bottom of the gmail main window you will find </em><strong><em>' Last account activity: '</em></strong><em> at the end of that line you will find a 'details' link which pops up a table showing your latest login information which gives you the option to logout from any other logins if any. please go ahead and do that.</em><br />
<em>- Then change the password, this may help if a hacker is keeping the connection live. At some point GoogleTalk must be reseting abnormally long connections due to the same risk and that will get rid of the hacker if he haven't changed the password before you do that :P (or even a bug which is doing the same)</em><br />
<em>- You can also try changing your security question and any other security information as well which was mentioned online, which I did not try myself.</em><br />
<em>- Also you may visit the below source which was suggested to my by </em><a href="http://www.twitter.com/NokiaHelps"><em>@NokiaHelps</em></a><br />
<span style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:arial, 'san serif';font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-size:small;"><a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Talk/thread?tid=704e8609f17cb695&amp;hl=en"><em>Gtalk status always showing as "available" even if I'm signed out from gtalk client</em></a></span></span></p>
<p>Try these and be patient if you are having the same problem.<br />
It will go away but I can not guarantee when as that may depend on the clearing process of GoogleTalk servers. My case it was about 2 days.</p>
<p>Anyways thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/nokia">@Nokia</a> for the support you have given, I feel that this should go a bit more further and thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a> for enabling me in engaging in such conversations which I would have never been able to, if not for twitter.</p>
