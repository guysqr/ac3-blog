<p>Social networking, whether you like it or not has become a big part in our lives nowadays. Basically everyone is onto it. In my case, my whole family is on facebook; which explains to what extent it has affected me. So sometimes I have to be selective on what I say on Facebook as my mom's watching me.</p>
<p>My Personal view is that Social Networking nowadays have gone bit more further than where it should have gone. Anyways..</p>
<p>Inspired by the this article on <a href="http://www.gadgetsandgizmos.org/facebook-and-twitter-now-nightly-routine-for-72-of-brits/">social networking becoming a nightly routine</a>, I decided to have my own poll on social networking habits before you sleep and come up with answers. Hope you guys will help me on this.</p>
