<p>Recently some of the mobile operators have started recycling their numbers where the numbers which has not been used for sometime are being issued to other customers even without informing the previous owner,which I don't see as a very good practice.</p>
<p>Seems like my old number also is issued to someone else and the guy who owns that is has become a nuisance to the people who have called to that number thinking that it was me.</p>
<p>So rather than doing such things, why not introduce the portability which many of the people are talking about these days. There was some buzz that this is coming, but seems like it will take longer in the typical Sri Lankan manner. But it's sooner the better we get these things in place.</p>
<p>What MNP or Mobile Number Portability means you can have the same number irrespective of the package you are using and irrespective of the network you are using.<br />

Have fun watching some advertisements done by idea to welcome MNP in India;</p>

<p>....and some Ads by Digi Malaysia;</p>

<p>As an example:<br />
In my case when I join my company, my existing number will be added to the same corporate VLAN allowing me to use the corporate services. If my company decides to make a shift to another operator they can do that and none of the numbers will change only the network will change.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
When this was first talked about many of the major mobile players didn't like this because they were afraid of the competition. As far as I see this is a very good concept because you are recycling the numbers which have not been used for sometime. So basically these customers are already lost so why not give them the graceful opportunity to leave with their existing number which will make life much more easier to them. Also a mobile user will not shift networks just to experiment. Only in the scenario of a major dissatisfaction they will consider this path, which will require to get some approval from a governing body such as the TRC which you don't want to follow unless you are really desperate. As I have found in many of the countries this has been implemented the shifting is very less due to following reasons as I see;</p>
<p>- Operators are providing a far better service as there is a higher risk of loosing the customers.<br />
- Operators have introduced cheaper contracted packages, so the customer can't leave until that is over.<br />
- The paperwork is quite cumbersome so they always think twice.<br />
before making the shift.</p>
<p>Yes, Implementing this will have some weight on the operators as all the existing systems will have to be changed to match the needs of MNP. This will favor the mobile Value Added Services (VAS) vendors, as the system will have to be upgraded to suit the new changes. But this cost is lesser than what you get out of implementing this mechanism.</p>
<p>So as a conclusion I say this is good, bring it up and let the consumers have what they deserve rather than operators dictating terms to consumers.(which is the wrong way what is happening in Sri Lanka)</p>
