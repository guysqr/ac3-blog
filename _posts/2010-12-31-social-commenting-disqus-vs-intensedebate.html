<p>As far as I see the initial adopter of social commenting was Google where they allowed users to comment with their Google profiles. With the introduction of the Facebook connect this became a total madness with many blogger and websites where everyone started to use it, including me which then proved to be unreliable and taking a long time to load. Then came twitter becoming one of the the early followers with many late followers to enter.</p>
<p>Then came the third parties such as <a href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> and <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> where they combined many of these social commenting providers to give a comprehensive solution with more interactivity and user friendliness. My first choice was IntenseDebete which I noticed an increase in the loading time of my blog after sometime, still the ongoing social commenting madness kept me away from reverting back.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Actually today many don't like to comment with social media like Facebook with the increasing threat of privacy and security (may be with the exception of twitter and few others) and what I noticed was that the social commenting madness settled a bit with all this controversies surrounding, while grabbing a high share of the blogs and other websites allowing comments and eating up loads of bandwidth from the internet users by connecting to different sites, loading numerous JavaScripts and making so many AJAX queries. With time I also wanted to revert back, but only then I found-out that there was no way to sync back the comments to blogger as that support was temporally suspended due to a bug by IntenseDebete, that temporary suspension then has become permanent. Also the exported comments file can not be imported by blogger. The next alternative was to import the comments to DISQUS which also failed to sync with Google even though they have the support on paper, at the point of granting Google access the operation fails. Also they didn't have the customization I preferred compared to IntenseDebete which made me stay with IntenseDebate for such a long time.</p>
<p>Then the time came for me to make the decision where I received complaints from my blog readers of inaccessibility of my blog over IE. Being a Linux user I never had much focus on IE but many, so I started to do the quality check with firebug and managed to sort-out any errors coming up on Firefox and Google-Chrome but when it came to IE(base was IE6) there was always some error, a JavaScript error thrown related to Facebook API from the IntenseDebate script.</p>
<p>Finally I gave up my love for IntenseDebete and made up my mind to move to DISQUS forgetting about all the difficulties I many face importing the comments and loosing the template I prefer. Even though I could not sync with Google I could import the comments after playing for a while with the exported XML where the Non-English comments didn't show up correctly and I had to edit it manually before importing to DISQUS. I took IE6 as the base browser for IE as IE6 was always a pain in the web developments I was involved, DISQUS could not even load the main page of my blog on IE6 which was asking me to download the blog, which was quite comical.</p>
<p>My faith on both those platforms was lost and my last decition was to revert back to old school commenting and loose all the comments with these so called interactive and userfriendly commenting plaforms, which actually makes the conversations more complex and difficult rather than making it simple and easy.</p>
<p>Social commenting has its advantages for sure but having that on your blog actually may not give you the same benefit you are expecting because of the poor cross-browser support and heavy loading time and unexpected behaviors. As per my googling the WordPress users are not facing the same deal of difficulties. For me I guess I'm happy with the default commenting with the expectation of the twitter comments integration in to that will happen soon.</p>

<p>Update: (14th January 2011)<br />
This was written when I was using Blogger, now I have moved to WordPress. After doing my R&amp;D for a while I figured out that most do prefer DISQUS over IntenseDebate for WordPress. No need to play around as most of the WordPress users have done that for you already so I have also moved to DISQUS.</p>
<p>I can sync the comments to my database (to WordPress) and keep them with DISQUS also and it seamlessly integrated with WordPress to access via the admin panel. The advantage I see is that most of the content related to the comments are actually stored somewhere else and the load to the hosing servers will be lesser by client scripting handling the load.</p>
