<p>I don't exactly like to keep a credit card because that will drain my wealth without even telling me. I have seen this happening to many of my friends. This plus the fear of internet fraud has kept me away from buying a credit. So I Googled for various options and found out this solution which is the Sampath Web Card.</p>
<p>Sampath Web Card which is a Prepaid debit card where you can top-up the card from any <a href="http://www.sampath.lk/" target="_blank">sampath bank</a> branch. All you have to do is make the payment with the card number as if you are paying for a credit card using a credit card payment slip. Also you can use this with PayPal. You can basically top-up the card up-to about Rs. 100,000 in deposit amounts in 2.5k, 5k, 7.5 and 10k rupees as per the website. But the guy at sampath told that I can deposit in any amounts as long as I use this for genuine purchase purposes. If you have a <a href="http://www.sampathnet.com/" target="_blank">sampathnet</a> account you can straightaway top-up the card from there after linking the card to the existing account. To check the existing balance either you have to call the cardcenter number which is at the back of the card or you can check it from sampathnet acount if you have that.</p>
<p>Here is the Link on Sampath Web <a href="http://www.sampath.lk/webcard.php" target="_blank">about the Web Card</a>.<br />
Here is the Link to <a href="http://www.sampath.lk/application.pdf" target="_blank">download the sampath web card application</a>.<br />

Following are the steps I went through to get the web card and verify my card with <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Made an initial payment of 2500 at the head office with my NIC number mentioned with "web card initial payment" as the receiver using a normal deposit slip (you have to do this only for the initial payment as you don't have the card/car number). Out of the payment 500 is taken as a onetime card charge, so when I got the card I had a balance of 2000 (if you have a sampath bank account the charge is only 300)</li>
<li>Handed that over to the card center with the filled application.</li>
<li>Received a call from sampath bank confirming my identity</li>
<li>After about one week got a letter asking to pick the card at head office as I have given my preference (there are other preferences such as receive the card by post)</li>
<li>Collected the card and the PIN at the head office.</li>
<li>Provided the card details to PayPal and verified, then you need the 4digit transaction id  to complete that. To get that either call card center number which is at the back of the card or you can check from the sampathnet account if you have linked the card to sampathnet account.</li>
<li>Gave the 4digits to PayPal and I was ready to purchase online.</li>
</ul>
