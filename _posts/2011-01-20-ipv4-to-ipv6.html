<p>IP Version 4 has almost come to its end. As per the time of this blog post the remaining count has dropped to less than 54 million addresses which is expected to be finished within 14 days.</p>
<p>Everyone its time to look at IP Version 6 and to prepare for the change if you already not taken the preparation steps. Ipv4 will not go away but will live in harmony with ipv6 where the new structure will be applied for the new ip addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>From Ipv4 to Ipv6 the 32 bit numbering will change to 128 bit with a vast increase of the number of IPs which can be provided (From 4,294,967,296 to 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456) which is the main reason to move for IPv6 to provide more IPs with the expansion of the internet.</li>
<li>For IPv6 the address formats will be in the hexadecimal representation like 3FFE:F200:0234:AB00:0123:4567:8901:ABCD compared to the dotted decimal notation of IPv4 like 173.192.231.62 which can not be remembered like IPv4</li>
<li>The IPv6 header has a new header format that is designed to minimize header overhead compared to IPv4.</li>
<li>From the DNS level Address (A) resource records in DNS to map host names to IPv4 addresses and Address (AAAA) resource records in DNS to map host names to IPv6 addresses.</li>
<li>In terms of security IPSec support is not optional in IPv6 where it was optional and implemented externally in Ipv4.</li>
</ul>
