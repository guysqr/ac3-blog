<p>"<a href="http://www.bing.com/" target="_blank">Bing</a> the search engine of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> is Copying <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> Search", the latest few words that everyone is buzzing. Latest post on the Google Blog "<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Bing uses Google search results—and denies it</a>" sums up the statement Google is trying to make.</p>
<p>Basically what Google is trying to prove is when a user makes a search for a keyword which is an unlikely keyword, Google will show the most relevant keyword and show the results for that keyword. But in Bing when you are searching the same unlikely keyword you get the result for the closest match  for the unlikely keyword search straightaway which is a sign of copying.</p>
<p>The "torsoraphy" is the keyword which stared the whole buzz, Where google was showing the results for "tarsorrhaphy" which is the closest match where as Bing was showing the same result when you are searching for "torsoraphy" which sounds quite fishy. Then there are various other combinations mentioned in the Google Blog such as "<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=hiybbprqag" target="_blank">hiybbprqag</a>", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" where Google has created artificially to point to unrelated search results which were also appearing in Bing Searches for the same keywords.</p>

<p>"torsoraphy" On Google</p>

<p>"torsoraphy" on Bing</p>
<p><a href="http://venura9.com/2011/02/04/bing-copying-google/bing-copying-google-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-487"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-487" alt="Bing Copying Google" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bing.jpg" height="173" width="367" /></a></p>
<p>Actually it is not possible for Bing to search for every possible keyword on Google and save that in a database, anyway Google have more than enough security to stop automated activity on search, for example if you have used the <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor Network</a> to access the internet in internet-filtered environments you may have seen that Google is asking to verify that you are human by typing something, because those types of services are making a considerable amount of hits to Google from one IP or a Pool of IPs. So that thinking can be totally ignored.</p>
<p>Ok then, how this may have happened? Google's suspensions are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 8, which can send data to Microsoft via its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/privacy.aspx">Suggested Sites</a> feature</li>
<li>the Bing Toolbar, which can send data via Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/EN-US/default.mspx">Customer Experience Improvement Program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are  known to send user experience and data back to Microsoft, So Bing may have got the search data through these channels.</p>
<p>Everyone is reading the Google stuff, but what about the answer from Bing (Microsoft ). This a quote from the ZDNet's blog post “<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-we-do-not-copy-googles-results/8557">We do not copy Google's results</a>”;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#808080;">“We use multiple signals and approaches in ranking search results.  The overarching goal is to do a better job determining the intent of the search so we can provide the most relevant answer to a given query. Opt-in programs like the toolbar help us with clickstream data, one of many input signals we and other search engines use to help rank sites,” said Stefan Weitz, Director, Bing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This post on the Bing Blog, <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/02/setting-the-record-straight.aspx" target="_blank">Setting the record straight</a> has the answers from Bing dening the allegations;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#808080;">Google engaged in a “honeypot” attack to trick Bing. In simple terms, Google’s “experiment” was rigged to manipulate Bing search results through a type of attack also known as “click fraud.” That’s right, the same type of attack employed by spammers on the web to trick consumers and produce bogus search results.  What does all this cloak and dagger click fraud prove? Nothing anyone in the industry doesn’t already know. As we have said before and again in this post, we use click stream optionally provided by consumers in an anonymous fashion as one of 1,000 signals to try and determine whether a site might make sense to be in our index.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Further more it is stating that Google has copied Bing, Quoting an article on The New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/technology/02google.html" target="_blank">Bing and Google in a Race for Features</a>;</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#808080;">Google has mimicked features like its travel search engine, its ability to tie more tools to social networking sites and its image search or buying start-ups to help it do so in the future.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#808080;">Google has even taken on some of Bing’s distinctive look, like giving people the option of a Bing-like colorful background, and the placement of navigation tools on the left-hand side of the page.</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Who has copied whom is still to be found-out, But for sure this will increase the competition among the leaders making the search tools more reliable and user friendly.</p>
