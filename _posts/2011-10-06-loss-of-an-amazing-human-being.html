<p>News which is spreading all around the world today is the death of one of the greatest innovators, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking at getting your life sorted out and getting it straightened you need to have a look at how this person lived his comparatively short life.</p>
<p>I will never be a fan of the closed apple ways of doing things. But I will always be admiring how Jobs brought apple to this place, How he innovated, how he made apple a force that all the giants wanted to beat. Mr. Jobs, fail well and innovation will miss you.<br />
