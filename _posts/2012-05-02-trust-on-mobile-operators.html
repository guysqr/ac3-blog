<p>Back-to-back blogs today...</p>
<p>This is just a picture I took at the university and I'm trying to give an interpretation to my observation.</p>
<p>Two guys trying to sell a product of a certain mobile operator and they are using numbers belonging to two rival operators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reason 1: These guys don't really believe in what they are going to sell (No.. Can't be... :P)</li>
<li>Reason 2: These two guys are trying to attract the users only from the rival operators and they want those guys to rach them easlity so that's the reason to use rival numbers (does this sound a bit LAME no way... :P)</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look and enjoy... Picture is bulky so will take some time to load....<br />
