<div>There are wordpress fans and also blogger fans. Wordpress guys have enjoyed having the Android application for some time now. </p>
<p>But even though the blogger app was available it was not enabled for our region. I even tried from Thailand still it was not enabled for them also. </p>
<p>Since few days I noticed that it's available via the official channel, the 'Google play store' . So good news for all blogger fans. That's if you have an un-rooted android like mine. </p>
<p>If you have a rooted device simply install the market enabler app and fake your carrier to be a US one and you can do anything :-) no need to wait...</p>
<p>Update:<br />Ah! Forgot to mention that this was also a mobile post :)</div>
