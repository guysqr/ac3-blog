<p>When I see the crappy service provided by my existing mobile service provider, I always feel like shifting. But.... I need this number, because everyone has this :'(</p>
<p>So MNP or Mobile Number Portability which enables you to switch operators without changing the number has become a valid requirement. </p>
<p>TRC SL had plans for this and I really don't know why it's not happening now. Many countries have done this including India. Why not us?</p>
<p>There have bee many initiatives taken for this but things are moving pretty slow and I feel that the major players may be behind this in the fear of loosing market share. But really,better the service the more customers you get ;)</p>
<hr />I have been going after the MNP for sometime now and you can read one of my posts on <a href="http://venura9.com/2010/12/20/mobile-number-portability-mnp-against-number-recycling/" target="_blank">MNP</a> on <a href="http://venura9.com/">venura9.com</a> to gain a bit more understanding.</p>
