<p>I will always be a WordPress fan for what they offer with the hosted solution. Yet to have simplicity and ease of not having to host I decided to go for blogger, with the aid of the android app which was<a href="http://miniblog.venura9.com/2012/06/blogger-app-available-for-android-in-sl.html" target="_blank"> made available for this region</a> recently.</p>
<p>I noticed that there was a new layout with blogger which was introduced recently and thought of giving a try for that. Within few days I noticed loads of drawbacks forcing me to revert to an older layout.</p>
<blockquote><p>YouTube video about dynamic views</p></blockquote>
<p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpDQF2lFnBU&w=560&h=315]</p>
<p>Issues I came across are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>No SEO as usual, Everything is in one page.</li>
<li>Same template(you can only change the colours) and no layout change, so you are not distinguished much from the millions of other users who use this.</li>
<li>Adsense support is available, but....... what you enable doesn't apply, they do it the way that they want to do.</li>
<li>Everything is generated dynamically and I doubt whether the search engines will have the capability detect the content</li>
<li>When you share using social sharing services there is nothing available to be grabbed from the post (e.g. Facebook sharing) so sharing becomes difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>All I see is bad and no good :(</p>
<p>Hope these will aid you guys to make your own decision if you are using blogger.</p>
