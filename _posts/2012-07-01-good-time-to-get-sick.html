<p>This was shown at the entrance of the Durdans Hospital, <a class="zem_slink" title="Sri Lanka" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=6.9,79.9&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=6.9,79.9 (Sri%20Lanka)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Sri Lanka</a></p>
<p>They have offers for you to get sick and pay in installments if you have a credit card from sampath bank. But you have to get sick while the offer is available....... What a lame advertisement :-D</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="HSBC" href="http://www.hsbc.lk" target="_blank" rel="homepage">HSBC</a> on the other hand has another offer going on. When I paid my bill I actually got 10% off from my bill.... Nice bill shock as I did not know about that until I paid and only saw the banner behind later.</p>
