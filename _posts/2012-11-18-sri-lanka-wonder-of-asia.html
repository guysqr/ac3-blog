<p>I was just going through the <a href="http://www.srilanka.travel/" target="_blank">Sri Lanka Travel Website</a> and came across this promotional video which had been released recently.</p>
<p>This seems to be more inline with the vision of Sri Lankan Tourism and worth sharing. Please make sure you do the needful by sharing this video to the world. Be Proud, Be Sri Lankan.</p>

<p>I thought the above was creative until I saw the below by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kegfire?feature=watch">Max kegfire</a> and Dima Viper. This is awesome guys! They must have really lived Sri Lanka</p>
