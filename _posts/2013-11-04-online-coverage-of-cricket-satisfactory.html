<p>Cricket itself has degraded the quality of matches due to various reasons and unfortunately India is in the forefront of that;</p>
<ul>
<li>Match Fixing</li>
<li>Cheating and being  biased</li>
<li>Having roads as pitches where it's not adding any value to cricket.</li>
<li>Not behaving like gentlemen on and off the field.</li>
<li>Of course the ill handling of online media and social media</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the last point only and try to elaborate more on it and not go into argument about the others. I just watched the last moments of the Ind Vs Aus match accidentally and was shocked to see the scores people have got in the last match and also during the series.  Inability to bowl in good pitches seems to have lead India to make the wickets become more and more closer to roads :)</p>
<p>But the funny part is these performances were praised by every website and social media related to them. So why is this happening... simple... they are again run by Indians. So... do you get the proper information/news when you access these sites? Absolutely No. But, unfortunately there are no proper alternatives to websites like cricinfo.</p>
<p>So biased that you can call <em><strong>cricinfo = cricindia</strong></em> ...</p>
<p>So even if we spread the news around there will be no alternatives, not enough coverage of matches, no mobile apps (Android, iPhone, Mobile Web, Etc.).</p>
<p>But this is to wake everyone up and to get you thinking in the right direction so that there will be a buzz around. May be to promote a less quality but less biased alternative which has the potential to grow...</p>
